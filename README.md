# Homepage: A HTML and CSS Project

This is the capstone project to the [Advanced HTML and CSS course](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript/courses/advanced-html-and-css) hosted by [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/).

Given a set of page images (see [project-designs folder](./project-designs/)), students are tasked with replicating the page design and making the page behave responsively based on the width of the screen. This provides an opportunity to practice using some of the responsive page design techniques covered during the course. Additionally, there is room to practice improving page accessibility and implementing CSS animations if desired.
